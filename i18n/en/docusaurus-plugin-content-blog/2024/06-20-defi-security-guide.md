DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is transforming the financial industry but also introduces new security challenges.

<!--truncate-->

## DeFi Security Risks

### Smart Contract Risks

DeFi protocols rely on smart contracts; any vulnerability can lead to fund loss.

### Price Manipulation

Attackers may manipulate price oracles through flash loans.

## How to Protect Your Assets

1. **Diversify Investments**: Do not allocate all funds to a single protocol.
2. **Use Audited Protocols**: Choose projects that have undergone security audits.
3. **Test with Small Amounts**: Start with a small test transaction when using a new protocol.

## Recommended Tools

- **DeFi Pulse**: Tracks DeFi protocols.
- **DeFiSafety**: Check security ratings.

## Conclusion

DeFi offers significant opportunities, but security issues must be approached with caution.
