Layer 2 solutions are rapidly evolving, but they also introduce new security considerations.

<!--truncate-->

## Layer 2 Types

### Rollups

- **Optimistic Rollups**: Optimistic execution.
- **ZK Rollups**: Zero-knowledge proofs.

### State Channels

Peer-to-peer off-chain transaction channels.

## Security Risks

### 1. Bridging Risks

Asset bridges between Layer 1 and Layer 2 are hotspots for attacks.

### 2. Sequencer Centralization

Sequencers in most Layer 2 solutions are centralized.

## Security Recommendations

- Understand the security models of different Layer 2 solutions.
- Diversify assets; do not store all funds on a single Layer 2.
- Monitor the decentralization roadmaps of projects.

## Major Layer 2 Solutions

- **Arbitrum**: Optimistic Rollup.
- **Optimism**: Optimistic Rollup.
- **zkSync**: ZK Rollup.
- **StarkNet**: ZK Rollup.

## Conclusion

Layer 2 offers scaling solutions, but it's crucial to understand their security trade-offs.
