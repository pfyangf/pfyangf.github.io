Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a key technology for privacy protection in blockchain.

<!--truncate-->

## What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any additional information.

## Application Scenarios

### 1. Private Transactions

Verify transaction validity without disclosing transaction details.

### 2. Identity Authentication

Prove identity without revealing specific information.

## Key Technologies

### zk-SNARKs

- Succinct proofs.
- Fast verification.
- Requires a trusted setup.

### zk-STARKs

- No trusted setup required.
- Quantum-resistant.
- Larger proof size.

## Real-World Projects

- **Zcash**: Privacy-focused cryptocurrency.
- **zkSync**: Layer 2 scaling solution.
- **Polygon zkEVM**: EVM-compatible ZK Rollup.

## Learning Resources

- ZK Whiteboard Sessions
- ZK Hack
- 0xPARC Courses

## Conclusion

Zero-Knowledge Proofs represent a crucial direction for blockchain technology development and are worth deep exploration.
